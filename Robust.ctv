    <p>
    Robust (or "resistant") methods for statistics modelling have been
    available in S from the very beginning in the 1980s; and then in R in
    package <code>stats</code>.
    <!-- not using <pkg... /pkg  for a standard i.e. non-CRAN package -->
    Examples are <code>median()</code>, <code>mean(*, trim =
    . )</code>, <code>mad()</code>, <code>IQR()</code>,
    or also <code>fivenum()</code>, the statistic
    behind <code>boxplot()</code> in package <code>graphics</code>)
    or <code>lowess()</code> (and <code>loess()</code>) for robust
    nonparametric regression, which had been complemented
    by <code>runmed()</code> in 2003.

    Much further important functionality has been made available in
    recommended (and hence present in all R versions) package
    <pkg>MASS</pkg> (by Bill Venables and Brian Ripley, see <em>the</em> book
    <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS4/">Modern Applied
    Statistics with S</a>).
    Most importantly, they provide
    <code>rlm()</code> for robust regression and <code>cov.rob()</code> for
    robust multivariate scatter and covariance.

    <p>
    This task view is about R add-on packages providing newer or faster,
    more efficient algorithms and notably for (robustification of) new models.

    <p>
    An international group of scientists working in the field of robust
    statistics has made efforts (since October 2005) to coordinate several of
    the scattered developments and make the important ones available
    through a set of R packages complementing each other.

    These should build on a basic package with "Essentials",
    coined <pkg>robustbase</pkg> with (potentially many) other packages
    building on top and extending the essential functionality to particular
    models or applications.

    Further, there is the quite comprehensive package
    <pkg>robust</pkg>, a version of the robust library of S-PLUS,
    as an R package now GPLicensed thanks to Insightful and Kjell Konis.

    Originally, there has been much overlap between 'robustbase'
    and 'robust', now <pkg>robust</pkg> <em>depends</em>
    on <pkg>robustbase</pkg>, the former providing convenient routines for
    the casual user where the latter will contain the underlying
    functionality, and provide the more advanced statistician with a
    large range of options for robust modeling.
    </p>

    <p>We structure the packages roughly into the following topics, and
    typically will first mention functionality in packages
    <pkg>robustbase</pkg> and <pkg>robust</pkg>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Regression (Linear, Generalized Linear, Nonlinear Models)</i>:

	<code>lmrob()</code> (<pkg>robustbase</pkg>) and <code>lmRob()</code>
	(<pkg>robust</pkg>) where the former uses the latest of the
	fast-S algorithms and heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation corrected
	(HAC) standard errors, the latter makes use of the M-S algorithm of
	Maronna and Yohai (2000), automatically when there are factors
	among the predictors (where S-estimators (and hence MM-estimators)
	based on resampling typically badly fail).

	The <code>ltsReg()</code> and <code>lmrob.S()</code> functions
	are available in <pkg>robustbase</pkg>, but rather for comparison
	purposes.

	<code>rlm()</code> from <pkg>MASS</pkg>.

	Note that Koenker's quantile regression package <pkg>quantreg</pkg>
	contains L1 (aka LAD, least absolute deviations)-regression as a
	special case, doing so also for nonparametric regression via
	splines.

	Quantile regression (and hence L1 or LAD) for mixed effect models,
	is available in package <pkg>lqmm</pkg>, whereas an
	<em>MM-like</em> approach for robust linear mixed effects modeling
	is available from package <pkg>robustlmm</pkg>.

	<!-- Never updated since 2007-07-23, archived on CRAN,  2012-10-29
	  - Package <pkg>mblm</pkg>'s function <code>mblm()</code> fits
	  - median-based (Theil-Sen or Siegel's repeated) simple linear models. -->

	Generalized linear models (GLMs) are provided both via
	<code>glmrob()</code> (<pkg>robustbase</pkg>) and <code>glmRob()</code>
	(<pkg>robust</pkg>).
	<!-- where the former is typically preferable -->

	Robust Nonlinear model fitting is available through
	<pkg>robustbase</pkg>'s <code>nlrob()</code>.

	<pkg>multinomRob</pkg> fits overdispersed multinomial regression
	models for count data.

	<pkg>rgam</pkg> fits robust GAMs, i.e., robust Generalized Additive
	Models.
      </li>

      <li><i>Multivariate Analysis</i>:

      Here, the <pkg>rrcov</pkg> package which builds ("<code>Depends</code>")
      on <pkg>robustbase</pkg> provides nice S4 class based methods,
      more methods for robust multivariate variance-covariance estimation,
      and adds robust PCA methodology. <!-- .... FIXME; there's more . -->

      Here, <pkg>robustbase</pkg> contains a slightly more flexible
      version, <code>covMcd()</code> than <pkg>robust</pkg>'s
      <code>fastmcd()</code>, and similarly for <code>covOGK()</code>.
      OTOH, <pkg>robust</pkg>'s <code>covRob()</code> has automatically chosen
      methods, notably <code>pairwiseQC()</code> for large dimensionality p.

      Package <pkg>robustX</pkg> for experimental, or other not yet
      established procedures, contains <code>BACON()</code> and
      <code>covNCC()</code>, the latter providing the
      neighbor variance estimation (NNVE) method of Wang and Raftery(2002),
      which used to be in a package <code>covRobust</code> no longer on CRAN.

      <pkg>mvoutlier</pkg> (building on <pkg>robustbase</pkg>) provides
      several methods for outlier identification in high dimensions.

      <pkg>FRB</pkg> performs robust inference based on <b>F</b>ast
      and <b>R</b>obust <b>B</b>ootstrap on robust estimators, including
      multivarate regression, PCA and Hotelling tests.

      <!-- Never updated since 2003-11-14, archived on CRAN,  2012-10-29
        - <pkg>covRobust</pkg> provides the
        - nearest neighbor variance estimation (NNVE) method of Wang and
        - Raftery (2002). -->

<!-- Package <pkg>MCLIME</pkg>'s function <code>m.clime())</code> fits -->
<!-- constrained L1 ...  MM: Its example never ran correctly, as they -->
<!-- did *not* escape '%' !! -->

      Note that robust PCA can be performed by using standard
      \R's <code>princomp()</code>, e.g.,
      <code> X &lt;- stackloss; pc.rob &lt;- princomp(X, covmat= MASS::cov.rob(X))</code>

      <li><i>Descriptive Statistics / Exploratory Data Analysis</i>: ... </li>

      <li><i>Time Series</i>:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Package <pkg>robfilter</pkg> contains robust regression and
	    filtering methods for univariate time series, typically based on
	    repeated (weighted) median regressions.</li>

	  <li>
	    Peter Ruckdeschel has started to lead an effort for a robust
	    time-series package, see <rforge>robust-ts</rforge> on R-Forge.</li>

	  <li>
	    Further, robKalman, <i>"Routines for Robust Kalman
	    Filtering --- the ACM- and rLS-filter"</i>, is being developed, see
	    <rforge>robkalman</rforge> on R-Forge.</li>
	</ul>
	Note however that these (last two items) are not yet available from CRAN.
        </li>
      <li><i>Econometric Models</i>:

	Econometricians tend to like HAC (heteroscedasticity and
        autocorrelation corrected) standard errors. For a broad class of
        models, these are provided by package <pkg>sandwich</pkg>.

	Note that <code>vcov(lmrob())</code> also uses a version of HAC
	standard errors for its robustly estimated linear models.

	See also the CRAN task view <view>Econometrics</view>
      </li>

      <li><i>Robust Methods for Bioinformatics</i>:

      There are several packages in the <a
      href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor project</a>
      providing specialized robust methods.
       </li>

      <li><i>Robust Methods for Surveys</i>:
	On R-forge only, package <rforge>rhte</rforge> provides a robust
	robust Horvitz-Thompson estimator.

      <!-- <li><i>Robust Methods for Geostatistics</i>: -->
      <!-- 	On R-forge only, package <rforge>georob</rforge> aims at -->
      <!-- 	robust geostatistical analysis of spatial data. -->
      <!-- </li> -->

      <li><i>Other approaches to robust and resistant methodology</i>:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The package <pkg>distr</pkg> and its several child packages
	    also allow to explore robust estimation concepts, see e.g.,
	    <rforge>distr</rforge> on R-Forge.</li>
	  <li>
	    Notably, based on these,
	    the project <rforge>robast</rforge> aims for the implementation of R
	    packages for the computation of optimally robust estimators and
	    tests as well as the necessary infrastructure (mainly S4 classes
	    and methods) and diagnostics; cf. M. Kohl (2005).
	    It includes the R packages
	    <pkg>RandVar</pkg>, <pkg>RobAStBase</pkg>, <pkg>RobLox</pkg>,
	    <pkg>RobLoxBioC</pkg>, <pkg>RobRex</pkg>.
	    Further, <pkg>ROptEst</pkg>, and <pkg>ROptRegTS</pkg>.
	  </li>
	  <li> <pkg>RobustAFT</pkg> computes Robust Accelerated Failure
	  Time Regression for Gaussian and logWeibull errors.
	  </li>
	  <li> <pkg>wle</pkg> <i>Weighted Likelihood Estimation</i> provides
	    robustified likelihood estimation for a wide range of models,
	    notably (generalized) regression, and time series (AR and
	    fracdiff).
	  </li>
	</ul>
