  <info>
    <p>
    Robust (or "resistant") methods for statistics modelling have been
    available in S from the start, in R in package <code>stats</code>
    <!-- not using <pkg... /pkg  for a standard i.e. non-CRAN package -->
    (e.g., <code>median()</code>, <code>mean(*, trim = . )</code>, <code>mad()</code>,
    <code>IQR()</code>,
    or also <code>fivenum()</code> (the statistic behind <code>boxplot()</code> in
    package graphics) or <code>lowess()</code>, which had been complemented
    by <code>runmed()</code> in 2003.

    Much further important functionality has been made available in package
    <pkg>MASS</pkg> (by Bill Venables and Brian
    Ripley, see <em>the</em> book
    <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS4/">Modern Applied Statistics with S</a>),
    notably <code>rlm()</code> for robust regression and <code>cov.rob()</code> for
    robust multivariate scatter and covariance.
    </p>

    <p>
    This task view is about R add-on packages providing newer or faster,
    more efficient algorithms and notably for (robustification of) new models.

    <p>
    An international group of scientists working in the field of robust
    statistics has made efforts (since October 2005) to coordinate several of
    the scattered developments and make the important ones available
    through a set of R packages complementing each other.

    These should build on a basic package with "Essentials",
    coined <pkg>robustbase</pkg> with (potentially many) other packages
    building on top and extending the essential functionality to particular
    models and or applications.

    Further, there is the quite comprehensive package
    <pkg>robust</pkg>, a version of the robust library of S-PLUS,
    as an R package now GPLicensed thanks to Insightful and Kjell Konis.

    Whereas there is currently quite a bit of overlap (between 'robustbase'
     and 'robust'), the intent (as of Nov.2007) is that <pkg>robust</pkg>
     will eventually <em>depend</em> on <pkg>robustbase</pkg>, the former
     providing convenient routines for the casual user where the latter
     will contain the underlying functionality, and provide the more
     advanced statistician with a considerable choice of methodology.
    </p>

    <p>We structure the packages roughly into the following topics, and
    typically will first mention functionality in packages
    <pkg>robustbase</pkg> and <pkg>robust</pkg>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Regression (Linear, Generalized Linear, Nonlinear Models)</i>:

	<code>lmrob()</code> (<pkg>robustbase</pkg>) and <code>lmRob()</code>
	(<pkg>robust</pkg>) where the former uses the latest of the
	fast-S algorithms and heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation corrected
	(HAC) standard errors, the latter makes use of the M-S algorithm of
	Maronna and Yohai (2000), automatically when there are factors
	among the predictors (where S-estimators (and hence MM-estimators)
	based on resampling typically badly fail).

	The <code>ltsReg()</code> and <code>lmrob.S()</code> functions
	are available in <pkg>robustbase</pkg>, but rather for comparison
	purposes.

	<code>rlm()</code> from <pkg>MASS</pkg>.

	Note that Koenker's quantile regression package <pkg>quantreg</pkg>
	contains L1 (aka LAD, least absolute deviations)-regression as a
	special case, doing so also for nonparametric regression via
	splines.

	Package <pkg>mblm</pkg>'s function <code>mblm()</code> fits
	median-based (Theil-Sen or Siegel's repeated) simple linear models.

	Generalized linear models (GLMs) are provided both via
	<code>glmrob()</code> (<pkg>robustbase</pkg>) and <code>glmRob()</code>
	(<pkg>robust</pkg>).
	<!-- where the former is typically preferable -->

	Robust Nonlinear model fitting is available through
	<pkg>robustbase</pkg>'s <code>nlrob()</code>.

	<pkg>multinomRob</pkg> fits overdispersed multinomial regression
	models for count data.

	<pkg>rgam</pkg> fits robust GAMs, i.e., robust Generalized Additive
	Models.
      </li>

      <li><i>Multivariate Analysis</i>:

      Here, the <pkg>rrcov</pkg> package which builds ("<code>Depends</code>")
      on <pkg>robustbase</pkg> provides nice S4 class based methods,
      that are planned to be moved into <pkg>robustbase</pkg>, and additionally
      robust PCA methodology. <!-- .... FIXME; there's more . -->

      Here, <pkg>robustbase</pkg> contains a slightly more flexible
      version, <code>covMcd()</code> than <pkg>robust</pkg>'s
      <code>fastmcd()</code>, and similarly for <code>covOGK()</code>.
      OTOH, <pkg>robust</pkg>'s <code>covRob()</code> has automatically chosen
      methods, notably <code>pairwiseQC()</code> for large dimensionality p.

      <pkg>mvoutlier</pkg> (building on <pkg>robustbase</pkg>) provides
      sign methods for outlier identification in high dimensions.

      <pkg>FRB</pkg> performs robust inference based on <b>F</b>ast
      and <b>R</b>obust <b>B</b>ootstrap on robust estimators, including
      multivarate regression, PCA and Hotelling tests.

      <pkg>covRobust</pkg> provides the
      nearest neighbor variance estimation (NNVE) method of Wang and
      Raftery (2002).

<!-- Package <pkg>MCLIME</pkg>'s function <code>m.clime())</code> fits -->
<!-- constrained L1 ...  MM: Its example never ran correctly, as they -->
<!-- did *not* escape '%' !! -->

      Note that robust PCA can be performed by using standard
      \R's <code>princomp()</code>, e.g.,
      <code> X <- stackloss; pc.rob <- princomp(X, covmat= MASS::cov.rob(X))</code>

      </li>

      <li><i>Large Data Sets</i>: ...

      (See also the CRAN task view
          <view>MachineLearning</view>.)</li>

      <li><i>Descriptive Statistics / Exploratory Data Analysis</i>: ... </li>

      <li><i>Time Series</i>:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Package <pkg>robfilter</pkg> contains robust regression and
	    filtering methods for univariate time series, typically based on
	    repeated (weighted) median regressions.</li>

	  <li>
	    Peter Ruckdeschel has started to lead an effort for a robust
	    time-series package, see <rforge>robust-ts</rforge> on R-Forge.</li>

	  <li>
	    Further, <pkg>robKalman</pkg>, <i>"Routines for Robust Kalman
	    Filtering --- the ACM- and rLS-filter"</i>, is being developed, see
	    <rforge>robkalman</rforge> on R-Forge.</li>
	</ul>
	Note however that these (last two items) are not yet available from CRAN.
        </li>
      <li><i>Econometric Models</i>:

	Econometricians tend to like HAC (heteroscedasticity and
        autocorrelation corrected) standard errors. For a broad class of
        models, these are provided by package <pkg>sandwich</pkg>.

	Note that <code>vcov(lmrob())</code> also uses a version of HAC
	standard errors for its robustly estimated linear models.

	See also the CRAN task view <view>Econometrics</view>
      </li>

      <li><i>Robust Methods for Bioinformatics</i>:

      There are several packages in the <a
      href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor project</a>
      providing specialized robust methods.
       </li>

      <li><i>Other approaches to robust and resistant methodology</i>:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The package <pkg>distr</pkg> and its several child packages
	    also allow to explore robust estimation concepts, see e.g.,
	    <rforge>distr</rforge> on R-Forge.</li>
	  <li>
	    Notably, based on these,
	    the project <rforge>robast</rforge> aims for the implementation of R
	    packages for the computation of optimally robust estimators and
	    tests as well as the necessary infrastructure (mainly S4 classes
	    and methods) and diagnostics; cf. M. Kohl (2005).
	    It includes the R packages
	    <pkg>RandVar</pkg>, <pkg>RobAStBase</pkg>, <pkg>RobLox</pkg>,
	    <pkg>RobLoxBioC</pkg>, <pkg>RobRex</pkg>.
	    Further, <pkg>ROptEst</pkg>, and <pkg>ROptRegTS</pkg>.
	  </li>
	  <li> <pkg>RobustAFT</pkg> computes Robust Accelerated Failure
	  Time Regression for Gaussian and logWeibull errors.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
